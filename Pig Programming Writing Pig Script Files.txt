--Pig Programming - Writing Pig Script Files
--Robert Esteves

-- script extension is .pig
<file_name>.pig

--run in local mode or hdfs mode

--call script in local mode

pig -x local '/home/cloudera/Desktop/stu_data.pig'

--call script in hdfs mode

pig -x mapreduce '/home/cloudera/Desktop/stu_data.pig'

--OR

pig '/home/cloudera/Desktop/stu_data.pig'

-- to execute the file in local mode you simple write do not use the single quotes
--just as the line below shows. This version applies to the grunt shell only

grunt>exec /home/cloudera/Desktop/my_stu_data.pig

--you can also run the script by just using the following command in local mode

cloudera@localhost ~]$ pig -x local '/home/cloudera/Desktop/my_stu_data.pig'

--in this version of the script you have to use the quotes since you are in
--the terminal

--To execute the script in hdf mode, you need to be in mapreduce. For example:
--also omit the the directory path inside the script just state the file name.
--because, the file is already in hdfs

grunt> pwd

grunt>pig -x mapreduce

--move to the directory in hdfs where the file is located and execute

grunt> pwd

--the result should be something like this

hdfs://localhost.localdomain:8020/user/cloudera/pigcourse

--execute the command below so you can view the file in hdfs

cat stu_data.csv

--now you can run the hdfs version of the script.
--remember, no single quotes around the file path

grunt> exec /home/cloudera/Desktop/my_stu_data_hdfs_fmt.pig
